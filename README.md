# S82X

This repository contains some of the n-dim array used in Peca et al. 2023 (see full paper for details):
- The "Corrections" folder contains the corrections to derive intrinsic AGN distributions.
- The "XLF" folder contains the derived X-ray luminosity function. Peca23_XLF.py shows how to use the XLF and obtain the number density of AGN [Mpc-3] for a given luminosity and redshift.

These files are free-to-use, but if you use them, please cite our paper:
