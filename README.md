This repository contains some of the n-dim array used in Peca et al. 2023 (see full paper for details):
- The `Corrections` folder contains the corrections to derive intrinsic AGN distributions.
- The `XLF` folder contains the derived X-ray luminosity function. `Peca23_XLF.py` shows how to use the XLF and obtain the number density of AGN [Mpc-3] for a given luminosity and redshift.

These files are free-to-use, but if you use them, please cite our paper [at this link](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv221008030P/abstract).
